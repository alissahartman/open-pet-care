Welcome to **Open Pet Care**! 

Open Pet Care is an open-source project to help pet owners manage preventive care for their pets.

It provides structured, trustworthy data on vaccine schedules, medications, and general pet health, along with reminders and human-readable guidance.

The goal is to make responsible pet care simple, accessible, and transparent — for developers, pet owners, and anyone who loves animals.
